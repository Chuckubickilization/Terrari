## Product direction

A concrete next-step design blueprint is available at:

- `docs/terrarium-next-step-blueprint.md`

It turns the current prototype into a focused roadmap for a cozy-but-addictive 3D terrarium simulator, including:
- core loop refinement,
- lessons from comparable games,
- progression/economy guardrails,
- highest-ROI feature sequence,
- milestone plan and KPI targets.
