# Terrarium Simulator — Next-Step Blueprint (from Prototype to Addictive Core)

## 1) Positioning: what game this should become

**Tagline:** *A cozy 3D terrarium builder with deep optimization layers and low-pressure daily progression.*

Your current prototype already has the right emotional ingredients:
- soothing ambience (day/night, weather, particles),
- tactile care actions (mist, fertilize, curate),
- small rewards (XP, gems, blooms, discoveries),
- short-session loops.

The best optimized path is to **double down on “cozy mastery”** rather than pure city-builder complexity:
- Keep sessions 5–12 minutes.
- Keep controls simple.
- Add strategic depth through **systems interactions**, not micromanagement.

---

## 2) Lessons from adjacent games (successes to copy, mistakes to avoid)

## Games to learn from

### A. FarmVille / social idle loops
**Use:**
- predictable short loops,
- daily objectives,
- streak psychology,
- event cadence.

**Avoid:**
- hard punishments for missing a day,
- spammy monetization pressure,
- mandatory social gating.

### B. Animal Crossing / cozy life sims
**Use:**
- gentle daily rituals,
- seasonal freshness,
- collection pride.

**Avoid:**
- slow early game unlock pacing,
- too much friction for rearranging spaces.

### C. Dorfromantik / Islanders (chill optimization)
**Use:**
- elegant scoring synergies,
- “easy to place, hard to optimize.”

**Avoid:**
- opaque scoring logic.

### D. Mini Motorways / Into-the-Breach style readability
**Use:**
- clear systemic feedback,
- visible cause → effect.

**Avoid:**
- hidden penalties and unexplained failures.

## 3) Refined core fantasy

> “I craft a living glass world, discover beautiful combos, and gradually master a tiny ecosystem that always gives me a meaningful thing to do.”

This shifts the game from “decoration only” to **decorative strategy**.

---

## 4) Stronger gameplay architecture (v1.0)

## A) Core loop (minute-to-minute)
1. Observe terrarium status (moisture, health, opportunities).
2. Take 1–3 actions (place, mist, prune weeds, harvest minerals, trigger boosts).
3. Resolve outcomes (XP, gems, ecosystem changes, discoveries).
4. Re-plan layout for next synergy target.

## B) Meta loop (session-to-session)
1. Complete daily quests + streak bonus.
2. Unlock new species/rocks/decor tiers.
3. Improve terrarium score and codex completion.
4. Participate in rotating themed events.

## C) Mastery loop (long-term)
1. Build around “biome archetypes” (Cloud Garden, Desert Glass, Luminous Cave, etc.).
2. Chase high-score “Harmony Ratings” per archetype.
3. Publish snapshots/seeds (async social).

---

## 5) New systems to add next (highest ROI)

## 5.1 Microclimate Grid (highest gameplay upgrade)
**Why:** turns placement into meaningful strategy while preserving cozy vibe.

Implement a hidden/lightly-shown grid under soil where each cell tracks:
- humidity,
- shade,
- mineral richness,
- airflow.

Each placed item influences nearby cells (auras).
Plants read local cell values and gain:
- growth bonus,
- bloom chance,
- rarity chance.

**Result:** adjacency becomes fun and intentional, like city-builder zoning but lightweight.

## 5.2 Species Needs + Traits 2.0
Each plant gets 2 preferred ranges and 1 personality trait:
- Fern: high humidity + medium shade.
- Cactus: low humidity + high sunlight.
- Moss: high humidity + low airflow.

Trait examples:
- “Nurse Plant”: buffs nearby immature plants.
- “Miner’s Friend”: +20% mineral maturation near rocks.
- “Night Bloom”: gains bloom chance at night.

## 5.3 Care Fatigue (soft anti-spam)
Current misting can be spammy if uncapped.
Add **soft diminishing returns**:
- first mist = full effect,
- second in short window = reduced,
- third = cosmetic only.

Keeps balance without feeling punitive.

## 5.4 Discovery Chains
Upgrade discoveries from random popups to short chains:
- Trigger condition,
- Follow-up action,
- Reward with codex lore + cosmetic variant.

Example chain:
1. “Condensation Prism” appears after 3 rainy windows.
2. Place crystal near fern.
3. Unlock “Iridescent Fern” skin.

## 5.5 Blueprints (save/load layouts)
Players can save up to N layouts and switch.
This massively increases retention and experimentation.

---

## 6) Addictive but gentle progression model

## Pillars
- **No hard failure.** Terrarium becomes suboptimal, not dead.
- **Always one rewarding action.**
- **Visible near-term goals + long-term collection.**

## Progress layers
1. **Account Level** (global unlocks).
2. **Terrarium Rank** (per-build score + badges).
3. **Codex Completion** (species/variants/discoveries).
4. **Season Pass Lite** (free track only at first).

---

## 7) Economy & balance guardrails

## Currencies
- Soft: XP, Gems (already present).
- Optional future premium: only cosmetics/extra slots, never power-gating core loop.

## Anti-inflation rules
- Scale late-game costs with logarithmic curve, not linear spikes.
- Hard cap stacked multipliers.
- Ensure at least one deterministic gem source/day.

## Reward cadence targets
- “Small reward hit” every ~60–120 seconds.
- “Meaningful unlock” every 1–2 sessions early game.
- “Collection milestone” every 3–5 sessions.

---

## 8) UX changes that will instantly improve feel

1. **Action heatmap overlay toggle** (humidity/mineral/shade).
2. **Plant status rings** with tiny icons (happy/thirsty/overcrowded).
3. **Cause-and-effect feed** (“+8 growth because Fern near Moss”).
4. **1-click ‘suggested move’ assistant** for new players.
5. **Photo mode** with depth of field + filters + sticker frame.

---

## 9) Social features without real-time multiplayer

You do **not** need synchronous multiplayer initially.
Best path:
- Shareable terrarium “seed code” (layout + weather state + season).
- Weekly community challenge (e.g., “Best Desert Duo score”).
- Vote/gallery with async likes.

This preserves cozy tone and keeps scope under control.

---

## 10) Production roadmap (optimized execution)

## Milestone 1 (1–2 weeks): “Strategic Cozy Core”
- Add microclimate grid.
- Add species preferred ranges + visible happiness state.
- Add clear synergy breakdown panel.
- Rebalance mist/fertilizer with soft diminishing returns.

**Exit criteria:** players can explain why one layout is better than another.

## Milestone 2 (1–2 weeks): “Retention Core”
- Discovery chains (at least 6).
- Blueprint save/load.
- Daily/weekly rotating challenge.
- Event-ready data tables (JSON-driven).

**Exit criteria:** D2 retention improves via meaningful return goals.

## Milestone 3 (2+ weeks): “Shareability & Polish”
- Photo mode + seed sharing.
- Seasonal cosmetic variants.
- UX polish pass (readability + onboarding).

**Exit criteria:** players share builds externally; measurable increase in session frequency.

---

## 11) KPIs to track from first playable

- D1 / D3 / D7 retention.
- Avg session length.
- Actions per session.
- % sessions with at least one completed quest.
- % players using blueprint feature.
- % players achieving first synergy in session 1.

If “first synergy in session 1” is low, onboarding/readability is the bottleneck.

---

## 12) Concrete implementation spec for your current prototype

## Data additions
- `cellGrid[x][z] = { humidity, shade, minerals, airflow }`
- `plantDefs[id].needs = { humidity:[min,max], shade:[min,max] }`
- `plantDefs[id].trait`
- `placedItem.influenceRadius`

## Runtime pass (every N seconds)
1. Clear grid to baseline.
2. Apply item influence falloff.
3. Evaluate each plant local-fit score (0–100).
4. Convert score to growth speed, bloom chance, XP trickle.

## UI additions
- Toggle: “Climate View.”
- Plant tooltip: `Local Fit: 78 (Great)` + reasons.
- Score panel: “Top 3 positive synergies / Top 2 blockers.”

---

## 13) Creative direction (ambience maximization)

- Sound layers tied to moisture + time of day (soft droplets, glass taps, wind hush).
- Very subtle camera breathing when idle.
- Seasonal particle mood shifts already good; extend with dynamic color grading LUT presets.
- Add “quiet milestones” (e.g., a single chime + slow glow sweep) instead of loud arcade popups.

---

## 14) Immediate next coding task (the single best next step)

Build **Microclimate Grid v0** behind a debug toggle.

Why this first:
- unlocks strategic depth,
- makes all future systems (traits, challenges, events) easier,
- provides a strong differentiator from “just another decorative sandbox.”
